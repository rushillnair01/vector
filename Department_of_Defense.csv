Our Phase I research confirmed it is possible to develop a portable, automated, efficient device usable by non-experts (e.g., forward-deployed soldiers) that automatically finds/analyzes 5G networks and provides a simple, actional report. The Navy needs such a device. During Phase I we: confirmed that differences/variances across 5G networks are sufficient to allow characterization, developed an optimized approach for rapid detection of 5G cells in a wide frequency spectrum, developed an optimized approach for raw signal (I/Q) capture, storage, and analysis,Â  tracked network through a 5G state machine to characterize/fingerprint/analyze networks with UEs, and obtained additional characteristics though probing and attacking. Based on our findings and discussions with stakeholders, we present a long-term solution to characterization of 5G networks with short-, mid-, and long-term deployment potential. Our solution is based on available COTS components combined with advancements to the state-of-the-art in signal detection, acquisition, storage, processing, and analysis leading towards more advanced active scenarios with antenna transmissions.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2331031

Recent developments in lead-based textured ceramic with properties between those of conventional PZT ceramics and relaxor single crystals can improve the performance of these systems, but need to be manufactured at high volume and low cost. Most approaches for manufacturing these textured ceramics involve tape casting thin sheets containing a mixture of ceramic powder and binder with embedded template crystals that are cut to size, laminated, fired (to remove the binder) and then thermally post processed to convert the material to a pseudo-single crystal. Even with high levels of automation, the process is laborious since it requires the casting and stacking of hundreds of layers to produce material thick enough to incorporate into transducers with resonances low enough for most Navy applications. MSI Transducers Corp.

In addition, we will replace simple textured ceramic plates or disks with structures that have higher performance, such a 3-3 composites and auxetic structures, to increase output, reduce the amount of textured material used and also decrease the weight of the transducer.

Unfortunately, transitioning riblets from machined aluminum panels to a format that can be utilized for large scale aerospace applications has been unsuccessful. Applique riblet films required significant application time and specialized workers. Utilizing photocurable coatings is a complex process that is beyond current industry capabilities. MTech believes there is an opportunity to leverage commercialized laser technology and apply it in a novel way to produce riblets directly into an already coated and cured surface utilizing direct laser interference patterning (DLIP). This technology would enable an economically feasible large-scale production of riblets on the range of 50-100 microns by a contact/wear-free continuous process. MTech has adopted specific technical objectives that define the research required to verify the geometric detail and resulting chemical composition of DLIP applied riblets.

These tests will confirm the durability of the riblets in the uniquely harsh operational environment that Naval aircraft experience. The impacts of riblets on routine maintenance will be invested and the maintenance level of any maintenance tasks will be determined.

Â Since decreasing aircraft drag can address both of these issues, it has received increasing interest.Â  Whereas reducing pressure drag through streamlining the vehicle has long been understood, reducing the viscous drag that accompanies the flow over any aircraft has been less studied.Â  In the 1980s, riblet surfaces were identified as a possible means of reducing viscous drag, but the practical implementation of these fine micro-structured surfaces was not considered feasible.Â  With the advances in materials and manufacturing processes as well as a renewed interest in drag reduction, riblets have received renewed interest over the past decade. Here, we propose to address one of the critical issues still challenging the use of riblets today - the ability to quickly and inexpensively fabricate and apply riblets to aircraft without adversely impacting their performance.Â  To accomplish this, we will model and demonstrate three separate manufacturing/application processes.Â  The first process is a roll-to-roll process where material from a first roll is imprinted with riblets that are stored on a second roll.Â  The roll of riblets is then applied to an aircraft surface in a separate process.Â  The second process is similar to the first, but instead of storing the imprinted riblets on a second roll, the material is directly applied to the surface.Â  The third process is a transfer coating process, where the top coating of the surface is directly imprinted with riblets using a transfer film. While developing these processes is important, it is our experience that assuring that the riblets produced have achieved the intended geometry is critical as is testing of the final product to ensure that the desired drag reducing characteristics have been obtained.Â  We propose to evaluate the manufactured riblets using a confocal microscope/profilometer that can accurately measure the riblet geometry to assess its accuracy and quality.Â  Similarly, we plan to test the riblets in a Taylor Couette cell as well as on a flat plate in a low-speed wind tunnel to assess the ribletsâ drag-reduction capability. Demonstrating the riblet fabrication/application, the riblet geometry measurement, and the riblet drag reduction measurement approaches will put us in the position to extend the work to more relevant shapes and conditions similar to those in flight.Â  This provides a methodical approach to mature the technology for application to commercial, transport, and military aircraft.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2329607

MDG will team with Progeny to leverage its previously developed and tested Advanced Submarine Control (ASC) scaled, motor drive and hubless Rim Driven Propulsor (RDP) thruster to provide a viable APU solution. The motor drive and RDP thruster has a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, which indicates that a system/subsystem model or prototype has been demonstrated in a relevant environment. MDG will leverage its naval architecture experience to make modifications to Progenyâs thruster design (i.e., propeller blades, aft stationary blades, duct inlet, and duct outlet). Design trade-offs will be made to balance the thrusterâs hydrodynamic design (i.e., efficiency, cavitation, swirl recovery) against motor and motor drive performance (i.e., power factor, switching frequency, harmonics, voltage, current, EMI) versus energy storage constraints against APU component integration (i.e., thrusters with deploy/retract mechanisms) beneath the stern platform of the SOCR. A quiet APU solution will enhance the capabilities of a SOCR to successfully perform slow, extremely quiet operations in contested environments. MDG has specialized capabilities for electric propulsion system design, naval architecture, hydrodynamic analysis, and system integration and is uniquely positioned when teamed with Progeny to provide an extremely quiet and rugged APU system for SOCR use. The MDG and Progeny teamâs revolutionary APU thruster, with its lightweight, compact, anti-fouling design, can easily provide these core needs observed across multiple industries, and its versatility allows for both retrofit and new construction.

A high-resolution optical camera will be mounted on the EOS M290 LPBF machine to collect layer-by-layer images. These images will be analyzed by an artificial intelligence (AI) model trained to detect layer anomalies such as spatter, streaking, hopping, part swelling, etc. An acoustic sensor will be deployed to capture airborne sound waves and analyzed to identify features denoting the evolution and presence of defects.

Extraction of relevant threat information and correlation across multiple modalities is required to take full advantage of the data available. VSI proposes TALON, a system for leveraging natural language descriptions of multi-int data, which are semantically rich, extremely flexible, and can be readily generated and processed thanks to recent advances in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Combined with geo-position and high-value individual (HVI) identifiers, natural language metadata can express a detailed description of virtually any activity or event with its surrounding context. The ability to generate semantically rich natural language-based metadata from multi-modal input source data provides a massive opportunity to leverage higher level reasoning and trend analysis tools originally designed for streams of text. The proposed threat identification system includes a suite of metadata generation algorithms based on state-of-the-art computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing technology designed to extract detailed content descriptions from multimedia source data. Potential threats are identified within the generated metadata stream by the proposed anomalous activity detection system based on deviations from dynamically learned normalcy models. In addition to developing algorithms for automatic metadata generation and threat analysis, significant effort will be devoted to the curation of rich multi-modal datasets and quantitative evaluation metrics. These datasets and evaluation metrics will be leveraged to establish feasibility of the proposed approach and identify key challenges to be addressed in Phase II. VSI and STR are uniquely suited to successfully execute this project thanks to their experience and expertise in computer vision, remote sensing, natural language processing, and data fusion. VSI and STR have an extensive track record of delivering innovative systems capable of extracting and fusing intelligence from raw data sources such as satellite imagery, news reports, social media, and structured data in challenging real-world problem domains.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2329663

Today, existing tools are time-consuming, workforce intensive, and cumbersome to process and distribute in a timely fashion. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be addressed using modern machine learning (ML). Mosaic ATM, Inc. is proposing the development of a software tool called Librarian, that a) accepts, parses, and stores multi-modal data sources; b) annotates the data source metadata; c) employs a collection of transformer-based neural network models that annotate and represent the content of the data as natural language or in an embedding structure that is common across all modes to allow cross-modality search; and d) exposes a user interface (UI) or application programming interface (API) that lets analysts easily query data across modalities. Mosaic's Phase I technical approach will be to first implement a solution using pretrained models to perform their native task or a related task using zero-shot inference. Example pretrained models that could be utilized include BERT-(language), CLIP-(visual-language), GPT-3-(language), and DETR-(visual-language and object detection). Second, Mosaic will enhance the performance of the innovation by incorporating domain-specific data. For language models, Mosaic will explore a self-supervised method called Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL). Mosaic will also explore an image model, specifically a technique called SimCLR. The third and final step will be advanced multi-modal inference which will be approached as a causal language modeling (CLM) problem, i.e., text generation. OpenAI GPT-3 is the current state of the art for such models and Mosaic will also explore a more cost-efficient variant of GPT-3, GPT-J or GPT-2 for fine tuning. The three scenarios that Mosaic proposes to utilize for ML algorithm development and model training are: Scenario #1) Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), protection, and defense of a key international maritime port utilized by commercial and military vessels of various nations; Scenario #2) Support of local LEAs conducting security at a high-risk event such as the Boston Marathon; and Scenario #3) Intelligence support of a Carrier Strike Group conducting an international strait transit such as through the Strait of Hormuz. As a means to bring capability to the end users in the most efficient and timely manner, Ultra has agreed to team with Mosaic for Phase II technology development and Phase III commercialization and U.S. Navy implementation. Ultra's Situational Awareness Management System (SAMS) is a proven ISR platform that is perfectly suited to host future Mosaic technology that will solve the Navy's, and perhaps DoD, challenges with respect to intelligence analysis efficiency and performance.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2329675

To maintain an asymmetric advantage in our military capabilities, better methods must be developed to improve the explosive yield of munitions through the use of reactive materials (RM) as a casing replacement or liner. RMs supply additional energy to blast and enhance blaster performance.Â  For low SWaP-C applications, there is a desire to replace liners and casings with RMs to provide a drop-in solution which enhanced blast performance and does not result in requalification of the explosive.

These objectives are typically not compatible in systems sharing a fixed volume and weight. Many munition systems have received propulsion and guidance upgrades over the years; however, most of those upgrades did not address warhead performance to combat emerging threats to our warfighters. The time and cost of developing a new munitions system with increased range and increased lethality utilizing conventional warhead technology are insurmountable given the required development and qualification schedules in this age of fiscal responsibility. A move towards the development and fielding of high-performance warheads in legacy systems is a novel approach to address range, precision, ship capacity and overall responsiveness to new and existing threats that will reduce the time and cost to field the upgrade.

In order to most effectively use these acoustic systems, there must be a good understanding of the sound speed throughout the water column. The water temperature and salinity profiles vs. depth are the critical factors that influence the speed of sound in a body of water. Sound speed is highly variable in the upper part of the water column, where seawater temperature andâin the Arctic, especiallyâsalinity can be both highly variable and dynamic in time and geographic location. Having an accurate real-time means of measuring the seawater temperature, and thus the sound speed in this upper part of the water column provides critical information to improve vulnerability assessments of subsea platforms, and the effectiveness of surveillance systems. Moreover, high-resolution, in-situ seawater temperature and sound velocity profiles collected over time in areas of interest enable improved accuracy of Naval Oceanographic predictive models, and benefits down-stream operations such as the Sonar Tactical Decision Aide (STDA) which are critical to maintaining acoustic superiority. To address this critical gap the Makai team is developing the ExREI (Extended Range Environmental Interrogator), a robust, deployable, multi-use sensor that measures key environmental properties that are processed in combination with a host platformâs hotel sensors to generate accurate and timely sound speed profiles in real-time.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2321553

ROMULUS enables decision-making agents (human and autonomous) to monitor the performance of the UUV, resolve emerging problems, and adapt MPs to improve mission outcomes. The ROMULUS prototype will overcome the communications challenges of operating undersea by synchronizing two DTs in parallel: the first onboard the UUV, the other offboard. Key innovations from Phase I were the (1) use of explicit expectations derived from DT predictions to compactly encode high-density UUV state information for efficient transmission over available communications networks, including acoustic channels, (2) tracking of state uncertainty between updates from the UUV, and (3) a modular design which is consistent with the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA) so DTs can interface with a diverse array of autonomy services and add functionality over time. Prior to starting a mission, ROMULUS takes the programmed MP and a priori estimates of the environment in the OPAREA as inputs and simulates over the MP to quantify the distribution of expected future states. During the mission, ROMULUSâ Onboard DT continuously ingests sensor and autonomy data to update estimates of the UUVâs state. When the state deviates significantly from the prior expectation, that triggers encoding a message to synchronize the Offboard DT. This approach is aperiodic and minimizes the comms required to be feasible over low-bandwidth, intermittent channels. By synchronizing states between onboard & offboard DTs, we can forecast the consequences of emerging problems on the vehicle or in the environment, and aids decision makers to adapt the MP if needed. These forecasts are published as services to other elements of the UUVâs Autonomy, which will enable long-duration autonomy by providing the situational awareness needed to adapt the MP without human intervention. Importantly, the synchronization with the Offboard DT also provides critical decision aids for the command team while supervising the UUVs autonomous mission performance to intervene when necessary to improve mission outcomes. We propose to prototype a ROMULUS system and demonstrate multiple use cases that were developed by interviewing Navy stakeholders during Phase I. Demonstrations will leverage a modeling & simulation environment. However, we also propose to conclude the Phase II with a final in-water demonstration by leveraging an existing REMUS 100 and facilities at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (subcontractor).",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2321641

Todayâs translation services do not generate contextual information about entity relationships within the text or provide advanced analytical tools (e.g., sentiment or topic extraction) that increase the understanding of the text. Many of the widely used natural language processing (NLP) tools (e.g., SpaCy, StanfordNLP, FLAIR and UD Pipe) have limited ability to automatically extract entities from non-English text and have difficulty resolving grammatical patterns outside of the subject-predicate-object pattern that is common in foreign languages. Current NLP tools are also limited because of their focus on efficiency over accuracy, use of models trained on small datasets, and support for a limited number of major languages [1-4]. Likewise, existing NLP tools are limited in their ability to identify relationships between entities in text and often rely on the user manually creating a defined set of rules that can be hindered by the complexity of word combinations in large volumes of data and do not readily evolve with changes to the input data. Furthermore, NLP tools do not offer services that confirm/identify the source of the text, correlate the source authors across documents, or readily identify differences in text sources based on language variances (e.g., sarcasm, figures of speech, and jargon). The overall objective is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver a text analytics tool that performs NLP directly on non-English text and allows users â not proficient in a target language â to gain relevant operational information. The tool will also provide information retrieval of relevant data artifacts and display the results (e.g., entity and event relation arguments) in a dynamic user interface. The following subsections describe N-TISE NLP applications that will assist intelligence analysts with gaining information from non-English text when the analyst does not have linguistic specialization in the target language. The modular dashboards benefit the end user by enabling the visualization of multiple NLP tasks simultaneously.

This programâs objective is to demonstrate a photonic processor system that uses a state-of-the art AI/ML architecture to classify targets from 4K, 480 fps camera imagery, while defining a near-term path to a photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based ATR system that processes speed photonic processor CNN implementation â¢ The University of Pittsburgh (Dr. Nathan Youngblood) recently demonstrated an integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of computing general matrix-vector operations at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (Tera-MAC/s). This approach to photonic computing can easily exceed the compute density of state-of-the-art digital processors by >1000Ã, leading to high performance computing systems with exceptional SWaP metrics. Our groundbreaking research provides a well-defined path to a future photonic integrated circuit (PIC) implementation of the discrete-component version proposed for this DP2 program. Tera-MAC/s PICs exhibit much lower energy consumption and much higher bandwidth than their electrical counterparts. They are also superior to traditional free-space optical approaches (e.g., 2f, 4f correlators) for AI/ML applications because their programmable tera-MAC/s computational ability can be applied to all layers of deep CNNs. We propose a 6-month Phase II âsub-phaseâ program to finalize requirements, refine the architecture, and develop a preliminary ATR system design. The system accepts PCIe imagery from a Ximea 4K 480 fps camera and formats that data for wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) fiber-optic transmission to a photonic processor that implements highly parallelized, first-layer CNN feature extraction. We will also complete a software simulation of our photonic processor to model its performance in a photonic ATR system. Also described (but not priced) in our proposal is a 12-month follow-on effort to complete the detailed HW/SW design and integrate/test the completed photonic processor-based ATR system. Following the demonstration we will deliver the integrated ATR system, documentation and final report.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2331643

In previous work, Bascom Hunter, partnering with Princeton University, demonstrated the performance of Matrix Vectro Multiplication (MVM) using PICs. We were able to implement 2x10 photonic arrays. The microring resonator (MRR)-based design was able to achieve a matrix loading speed of 2 Gbps, an input vector loading speed of 24 Gbps and an energy consumption per multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation of 1 pJ/bit. With a 2x2 matrix, we have shown computational performance of 0.16 Terra Operations Per Second (TOPS) and a latency of 200 ps. The latency of 200 ps can be compared to Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) latency of 10 ms. In Phase II, we will be laying the groundwork for the PHASOR product. We will be utilizing the previously designed 2x10 photonic MVM to create a CNN for MNIST classification. Our proposed design can implement a 4x4 MVM kernel (utilizing two 2x10 PICs) with a modulated laser input at 10 GSps (Vector update speed) and an MRR update at 1 GSps (Matrix update speed).

In parallel, these technologies will allow for sophisticated high-speed maneuverable vehicles and missiles. As the United States maintains strategic advantages on these technologies, it is imperative that the U.S. also maintain superior counter technologies, including the ability to detect, track, classify, and extrapolate hypersonic targets of interest for early warning systems. Naturally, existing overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors provide an excellent medium to apply state-of-the-art machine learning and/or artificial intelligence technologies for hypersonics but there are a numerous challenges. First, conventional machine learning techniques rely on detailed image features for classification whereas OPIR sensors are far from earth and targets will appear small (e.g. 2 pixels) in images, thus lacking clearly defined static image features. This will require the adaptation of current machine learning techniques to pull classifications features from time dependent target kinematics and behaviors rather than relying on just a single image. Second, environmental background clutter conditions in the OPIR will vary wildly due to differences in the large terrain covered by the sensor as well as effects of clouds, glint, sensor noise, etc., yet performance characteristics must achieve a minimum baseline of consistency. Most importantly, however, is that all empirically trained parametric algorithms like neural networks require a representative training dataset to achieve performance. To address the emerging needs of hypersonic target and track in low earth orbital (LEO) OPIR systems, EpiSciâs algorithm team has partnered with Raytheon Missile Systemsâ modeling and simulation team to propose AIded HyperTRACE, a modular tactical AI detection, classification, and predictive tracking system. The approach aims to use Raytheonâs 15 years and more than $10M in high fidelity IR and sensor simulation development to produce representative training and evaluation datasets of hypersonic targets in complex environments and adverse conditions. The datasets will be used to train and replace conventional detection, classification and tracking modules with state-of-the-art modular neural network components efficiently and rapidly with multiple evaluation stages throughout program execution.",https://www.sbir.gov/node/2331741
